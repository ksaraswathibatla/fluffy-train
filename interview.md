## Six Months Prep

This is a timeline and the books needed for the interview preparation. Structuring them in such a way that 2 hours a day will suffice. If you can get in more, even better.  There are three different parts to these interviews, coding which consists of datastructures and algorithms which can range from leet code easy to hard. By far, coding interview is the toughest to crack, considering the diverse areas of data structures and algorithms that can be used to solve problems.      

It's not Rocket Science, it just needs a lot of practice and mindful preparation. 

#### CODING INTERVIEW
Pick your favorite language and keep grinding on Leet Code. 

These would be the way I would go about preparing for the coding interview. 
1. https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview -- Try to spend one hour a day on this before going on to solving LC. Understand the patterns, solve the problems before going to the solution page. It is paramount that you understand these patterns, as any coding problem can be broken down to these patterns.
2. https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU -- This will be the begining of the LC grind. Make sure to solve one easy and one medium every day, once you are done with the patterns. 
3. Pick 100 problems from all the different data structures and algorithms in leetcode (will try to add them here). For e.g. for dynamic programming pick 4 easy, 4 medium and 2 hard. Keep track of what you are able to solve and what you need to repeat using excel or Notion like application.
Key is to KEEP SOLVING 2 a DAY NO MATTER WHAT. 

Books to Read for Coding Interview:
1. This is a very short book that gives illustrated understanding on what are the algorithms that are most asked: https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceb7felsabrpwl3peg2ocigebwh7o52rc6nrpepi56quvkc33cy3ae?filename=Aditya%20Bhargava%20-%20Grokking%20Algorithms_%20An%20illustrated%20guide%20for%20programmers%20and%20other%20curious%20people-Manning%20Publications%20%282016%29.pdf 
2. Cracking the Code Interview by Gayle Laakman: https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzaceamm7eobaki7b53aczpt7kfly5vq3t7djmalmcoqazefyr57ffcis?filename=Gayle%20Laakmann%20McDowell%20-%20Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview_%20189%20Programming%20Questions%20and%20Solutions-CareerCup%20%282015%29.pdf. This is a very intense book, it covers all the topics asked at FAANG, but all the code is in JAVA. 

#### System Design Interview
This is all about how will you design systems at scale. Understanding of the terms like scalability, reliablity, availability, cap theorem would be critical in acing these system design interviews. 

In these interviews, the interviewers are looking for these things
- [ ] What are the tradeoffs you are considering while designing the system
- [ ] understanding of scalability in the cloud provider
- [ ] Understanding of Caching and ability to demonstrate consistent caching
- [ ] Cap theorem, SQL vs NO SQL, Transactions vs Queues, Eventual Consistency vs Strong Consistency 
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster vs cloud functions (lamda in AWS)
- [ ] Do you understand database sharding and partitioning? 
- [ ] Are you considering event driven architectures when it fits
- [ ] Domain Bounded context while designing microservices
- [ ] Coupling, Cohesion in microservices
- [ ] Load Balancing, all the types of load balancing and when to use what. 
- [ ] Observability into the system design, distributed tracing of microservices. 
- [ ] Logging and Error monitoring frameworks which tie into the above point
- [ ] Edge Networks i.e. CDNs 
	 
This primer will act as an entry point into the cruel world of designing systems for millions of daily active users
